ASP.NET and C# Shipping Calculators for UPS, FedEx and USPS

> There were no really good shipping calculators in .NET out there, so I took the logic from a few different sources out there (mostly) PHP for USPS and UPS, and used the FedEx documentation for their web service. We use this on our shopping site http://www.ushopfast.com hope this helps!

> You will need to review the UPS, Fedex and USPS documents to see the different service codes. Keep in mind this code is really just a starting point since all the .NET Calculators for shipping are are either very crappy with support or just don't exist.

> Thanks to Mark Sanborn for providing some of the starting code and making it available on his site, the PHP version for UPS and USPS are what I used as a starting point. http://www.marksanborn.net/php/calculating-ups-shipping-rate-with-php/.
